        "text": "\n## Why this catalog?\n\nThe interministerial base of free software (SILL) is the catalog\nof reference of free software recommended by the State for all\nadministration.\n\nThis catalog helps administrations navigate through the\nfree software they are encouraged to use, following\n[Article 16 of the Digital Republic\nAct](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033205068):\n\n> \"The administrations mentioned in the first paragraph of Article L.\n> 300-2 of the code of relations between the public and administration\n> shall ensure the control, sustainability and independence of\n> their information systems. They encourage the use of\n> free software and open formats when developing,\n> purchasing or using all or part of these information\n> systems.\"\n\nIt is published by the [free software mission](https://code.gouv.fr)\nof the ([DINUM](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr)) on the website\n[code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill). It is built\ncollaboratively by a community of public servants who\nvolunteer as referents, technical experts or not, or declare themselves\nusers. These public servants can be from any of the three\npublic service branches: State, hospital, and territorial.\n\nFor any questions, you can write to the free software mission\nthat coordinates this community: <floss@numerique.gouv.fr>\n\n## The criteria for a software to enter the SILL\n\nFor free software to be included in the SILL:\n\n- Its source code must be published under one of the [accepted free licenses](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/doc/licences-libres-dinum/), with no delay between the publication of the source code and that of the executable files.\n- It must be deployed by the IT department of a public institution or installed by a public servant on their workstation.\n\nFree software used as *Software as a Service* can be\nreferenced provided that the administration is technically or\nadministratively in charge of the servers where the software\nis deployed.\n\nMultiple software with similar functionalities can be included\nin the SILL (see for example these [text\neditors](https://code.gouv.fr/sill/detail?name=GNU%20Emacs), or these\n[content management\nsystems](https://code.gouv.fr/sill/detail?name=Drupal)): the\nSILL referents work to evolve the SILL so that\nthis catalog helps to choose between these multiple solutions.\n\n## How to add free software to the SILL?\n\nFor software to be referenced in the SILL, one or\nmore public servants must volunteer to be its\n*referents* or *users*.\n\nTo become a SILL referent or user, create an account on\n[code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill). From there, you can\neither add new free software, or add yourself as a\nreferent or user of free software already present.\n\n## What does it mean to be a \"referent\" for a software?\n\n### Who can be a \"SILL referent\"?\n\n**Any public servant**, permanent or contractual, working in a\npublic organization from one of the three public service branches can be a\nreferent for free software that they use on their workstation\nor that they know is used in their administration.\n\nReferents must register with their personal email address:\nfunctional addresses (like sill@ministere.gouv.fr) are\nnot allowed.\n\n### What are the tasks of a referent?\n\n**The referent:**\n\n1.  attests to the use of free software in their administration or on their workstation;\n2.  helps keep useful information about the software up to date (recommended minimum version, information sheet, etc.);\n3.  agrees to be contacted by email by other public servants registered on the [code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill) website;\n4.  seeks a replacement referent if they can no longer serve as referent.\n\n### Who has access to a software's SILL referent?\n\nOnly people registered on the\n[code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill) website can access the\nemails of SILL referents and users.\n\n## License for SILL data\n\nThe SILL is published by the interministerial mutualisation groups\nunder [Open License\n2.0](https://github.com/etalab/Licence-Ouverte/blob/master/LO.md).\n"

Some of the information displayed is\nextracted from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), a collaborative\nand free database.\n\n## Account Creation\n\nAccess to the complete SILL records requires registration and\nauthentication. Only public officials can create an account.\nIf you are a public official and your email is not accepted in the\nregistration form, you can write to\n[floss@numerique.gouv.fr](mailto:floss@numerique.gouv.fr).\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\n### SILL Data License\n\nSILL data is\n[downloadable](https://code.gouv.fr/sill/api/sill.json) in\n`json` format and is published under the [Open License\n2.0](https://github.com/etalab/licence-ouverte/blob/master/LO.md).\n\n### Intellectual Property Rights Pertaining to Platform Content\n\nCertain documents present on the platform may be\nsubject to intellectual property rights.

The provisions relating to their processing must\nbe communicated by the user to the data protection officer\nof their administrative entity.\n\nEach user undertakes to comply with the obligations resulting\non the one hand from Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to\ninformation technology, files, and freedoms, and on the other hand from\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection\nRegulation).\n\nThe user further undertakes not to deposit any\ndirectly identifying data on the platform. Thus, only the deposit of data\nafter at least pseudonymization is authorized. Any user who\nimplements non-compliant processing will have their access to the\nService immediately revoked.\n\n## Modification and Evolution of the Service\n\nDINUM reserves the right to evolve, modify, or\nsuspend, without notice, the Service for maintenance reasons or\nfor any other reason deemed necessary. The terms of these\nconditions of use may be modified or supplemented at any\ntime, without notice, according to changes made to the\nService, legislative developments, or for any other reason\ndeemed necessary. These modifications and updates are binding on\nthe user who must, consequently, refer regularly to\nthis section to check the general conditions in force\n(accessible from the homepage).\n\n## Applicable Law - Disputes\n\nThe Service and these general conditions of use are\nsubject to French law. In the event of a dispute, the\nFrench courts will have jurisdiction.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions about free software in general, you can\ncontact DINUM via the address\n[floss@numerique.gouv.fr](mailto:floss@numerique.gouv.fr).\n"
